	          Internet is the world largest computer network. <br>
	          The basics of the web: <br> - <span class="italic">The web</span>: a bunch of computers that communicate with 
	          each other <br> - <span class="italic">HTML</span>: main document type on the web: glues all types of documents together  <br> - <span class="italic">URLS</span>: how you refer to documents on the web <br> - <span class="italic">HTTP</span>: protocol that units the web <br> - <span class="italic">Web Applications</span>  <br> - <span class="italic">Servers</span>: computers that host the sites that make up the web <br> - <span class="italic">Browser</span>: a program that runs on computers to display sites found on the web <br> - <span class="italic">Web page</span>:a text document written in a language HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	          When a person goes to a web page like 
	          www.google.com, their computer sends a 
	          <span class="italic">HTTP Request</span> to 
	          a <span class="italic">server</span>. 
	          The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends 
	          it back to the user's computer where a <span class="italic">
	          web browser</span> interprets the page and displays it on 
	          the user's screen.

	          HTML documents are made of HTML

	          tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML 
	          <span class="bold">tags</span>: <br> - Element is everything between  opening and closing tag <br> - Void tags are tags, which don't have closing tag. They don't have content. (e.g. img , br, ..) <br> - Inline tags vs block tags: inline tags for text, bloc tags are creating "invisible boxes" around the content.  <br> - Examples: a = anchor tag, p = paragraph tag, b = bold , em = italic .. <br> - Container elements: (e.g. Span , div ) do nothing but contain stuff inside of them. These elements can be used to create web pages with complex structures. <br> - Attirbutes: HTML elements can have atributtes. Attribute provides additional information about an element. The value of attribute "Class" is refered to also in CSS and helps to avoid repetition in programming the style.

	        The "tree-like structure" of HTML

	      <div class="concept-description">
	        <p>
	          The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML 
	          elements can have other elements inside of them. You can 
	          draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother 
	          had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
	        </p>
	        <p>
	          -	When programmers talk about the "DOM" they are talking  about the tree-like structure of a page. <br>
			  -	DOM - Document Object Model - a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	          In a browser, this structure shows up as a series 
	          of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes 
	          inside of boxes, and so on...

	        <p>
	          When you read an HTML document as 
	          <span class="italic">text</span>, you see a wave of 
	          changing indentations going up and down the left side 
	          of the document. The more indented an element is, the 
	          more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.

	        Text Editors (for programming)
	      </div>
	      <div class="concept-description">
	        <p>
	          When writing code, programmers use special text editors 
	          (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the 
	          programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors 
	          will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you 
	          write an opening tag.

	          For small project scratchpad.io is a great tool.As your web page gets bigger, you'll want to use a program that you can keep on your computer like Sublime.

	        <p>
	          Editors like Notepad, TextEdit are not recommended for writing computer code.

	          CSS Cascading Style Sheets - style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. <br>
	          -	HTML and CSS are both "languages" <br>
			  -	HTML controls the "structure" of a web page  <br>
			  -	CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks).
	        </p>
	        <p>
	          A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.

	          Selectors are used to conect CSS style rule with HTML elements. CSS rule contains selector, property, value. Example: h2 {font-size: 20px;}
	        </p>
	        <p>
	          Selectors may apply to: <br> - all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second level headers h2 <br> - elements specified by attribute (e..g. class) <br> - elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree (cascading rule) <br> - Cascading rule: Rather than write separate rules for each HTML element, global/parent rules can be used to style all nested/child elements. The rule defined last, applied to the element closest to the content, or that uses the most specific selector, "wins"

	        <p>
	          There are three ways you can do this: <br> - Method 1: write CSS in the head  of your HTML: used for small projects <br> - Method 2: Link your HTML to a separate CSS file: it lets you stay more organized when working on larger projects (the link in HTML document to CSS sheet should be defined in head of HTML) <br> - Method 3: Write your style inline with your HTML: This is generally a very bad idea because it leads to lots of repeated code.

	          The Box Model
	      </div>
	      <div class="concept-description">
	        <p>
	          There are four main points  about box sizing. <br>
				1.	HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components: <br>    - margin: clears the area aroung the border, pushes other elements away
				<br>    - border
				<br>    - padding: clears the area around the content
				<br>    - content <br>
				2.	Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right. There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues.<br>
					-	Set sizes in terms of percents rather than pixels.<br>
					-	Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.  <br>
				3.	Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code different.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	          Box positioning: <br>
				-	Block elements (e.g. div) by default take up the entire width of a page  <br>
				-   Adding the rule <span class="italic">display: flex</span> to the appropriate CSS will override the default bahavior and let the block elements appear next to each other

	          Steps of the process of developing the code for webpages: 
	        </p>
	          	<ol>
	          		<li> Look for natural boxes </li>
	          		<li> Look for repeating styles, semantic elements </li>
	          		<li> Write html</li>
	          		<li> Apply styles (from biggest to smallest)</li>
	          		<li> Fix things</li>

	           Steps of development cycle: code, review, refine
	        </p>
	        <p>
	          Important: <br>
	          It is very important that computer code is sturctured and that the code is not repeated. In my (our) example there is structure of:
			</p>
	          	<ol>
	          		<li> header</li>
	          		<li> body
	          			<ul>
	          				<li> Lesson (there are more lessons in html and only one style for lessons in CSS)
	          					<ul>
			          				<li> concept
			          					<ul> 
			          						<li> concept title</li>
			          						<li> concept description
			          							<ul>
			          								<li> Paragraph</li>
			          							</ul> </li>
			          					</ul></li>
			          			</ul></li>
			          		<li> footer</li>
			          	</ul></li>
				</ol>
	        <p>
	        	In my example there are many Lessons in my HTML and only one style for Lesson in CSS. It is very important that the code is not repeated (e.g. it is not good to write style separately for each lesson in CSS). The benefit of avoiding repetiton is: 
	        </p>
				<ul>
	        		<li> it is more easy to refine  the code</li>
	        		<li> it is more easy to read the code</li>
	        		<li> it is less code, transparent</li>
	        		<li> it is easier to implement changes...</li>
	        	</ul>

	        What is object oriented programming
	      </div>
	      <div class="concept-description">
	        <p>
	          Is a technique to write and share code amongst each other. It focuses more on working with data and processing them than on the methods which enable us to do so.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	          Why it's good? Allowes us to reuse code(methods + attributes, classes + modules, inheritance,...) in many different places, allowes us to follow an intuitive model of how things exist in our brain.  Just as functions makes updating code easier, using object-oriented programming techniques also organizes your code to make changes easier. It is very valuable tool for thinking about large programming projects.

	        Important concepts
	      </div>
	      <div class="concept-description">
	        <p>
	          <b>A class</b> is a code (that stores methods and variables (instance and class variables)), which serves as blueprint (template) for creating examples (instances, objects) according to the blueprint. In our example we used class Turtle, which has information how to move turtle in different directions…
	        </p>
	        <p>
	          <b>An instance or an object</b> of a class is an example made according to class (blueprint). In our example the instance of a class Turtle was brad (square). Another instance was angie (circle). <br>We can compare a class and its instance with a Recipe Book, the instance of a Recipe Book is food Chocolate Cake. 
	         </p>
	         <p>
	          In classes, we can also define variables. There are 2 kinds of variables: <b>instance variables</b> and <b>class variables</b>. Instance variables are variables of instances of a class. The value of instance variable is private for instance (other instances cannot access it). They are initialized by a <b>constructor</b>. A constructor is a function that creates space and memory for instances of classes. We used the __init__ function as a constructor. On the other hand, <b>class variables</b> are shared by all instances of a certain class and are defined outside the constructor.
	         </p>
	         <p>
	          Another important concept of OOP is <b>inheritance</b>. If we write several classes that are similar to each other and share some instance variables, we can avoid repetition of code by writing a "parent" class, which will include all the instance variables and methods that “child” classes share. So by calling a child class, we can access all class methods (and instance and class variables) defined in the “parent” class, as well as the ones in the (specific) child class. So we, with an instance of a "child" class, can call any method in a parent “class”. So, if in the "parent" class, there was a method called "show_info", which would print out certain information about an instance, we would be able to call it with an instance of a "child" class, because the "child" class inherited it from the "Parent" class. But if we chose to define a function with a same name, which would do different things (like print out more information about an instance), and if we called that function with the "child" class instance, the method defined in the "child" class would be called. That is called <b>method overriding</b>. 
	         </p>
	         <p>
	          <b>A module</b> (in Python) is a folder in which classes are stored. By importing a module to our program, we can access its classes and create instances of them. We can also import specific classes from a module and then only use certain functions of a class (by using a from…import… statement). 
	         </p>
	         <p>
	          <b>A language library</b> is a collection of functions and classes which are already defined and we can use while writing our programs.

	      <div class="concept-description">
	        <p>
	          We can compare HTML and CSS classes to Python classes. If you add a class to a HTML element, you can then add the same style properties to all the elements of that class, e.g. text colour or font, but the text itself is different. Python classes work similarly, all their instances share the same information and can access the same methods, but they are different. We can make an instance of class Turtle, which draws a square and another one, which draws a circle. They both drew something, the only difference was in what they drew. So HTML elements to which a class is added are very similar to instances or objects of classes in Python and CSS is similar to a class in Python.
